I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I will start my research group in Fall 2026. My work lies at the intersection of condensed matter physics and quantum information science, combining approaches from superconducting circuits, nanomechanics, and strongly correlated electron systems to probe, manipulate, and harness quantum behavior at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales.

I am currently a postdoc at UC Berkeley, working on hybrid superconducting-qubit and quantum-phononic systems. I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from UC Santa Barbara, where I studied strongly correlated phases in two-dimensional materials.

**I am actively recruiting Ph.D. students and Postdoctoral Researchers to join my group at UMass. If you are interested in quantum materials, superconducting circuits, nanomechanics, or quantum information science, I would be delighted to hear from you.**

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
