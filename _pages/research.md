My group investigates quantum phenomena in electronic materials and engineered quantum devices, bringing together ideas from condensed matter physics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. Our work spans three interconnected directions:

### **cQED Quantum Sensing of Correlated Matter**

Superconducting qubits and resonators provide quantum-limited sensitivity to charge, flux, and mechanical motion, making them powerful probes of macroscopic quantum behavior in correlated and topological materials. We use circuit QED (cQED) techniques to study:

- order-parameter fluctuations near quantum phase transitions  
- collective excitations such as plasmons, magnons, and amplitude modes  
- microscopic mechanisms behind unconventional superconductivity  

By coupling qubits to material excitations in the GHz regime, we reveal dynamical processes invisible to transport or optical probes, helping uncover how collective coherence emerges from interacting electrons.

Quantum materials—including chiral superconductors, van der Waals heterostructures, and engineered interfaces—provide new opportunities for building next-generation quantum hardware. We design devices where material properties directly enhance coherence and functionality.

Key efforts include:

- symmetry- and topology-protected Josephson devices  
- heterostructure-based quantum transducers  
- low-loss superconducting circuits using emergent interfacial responses  

These devices aim to achieve quantum functionalities that arise from the physics of the material itself, enabling scalable architectures for quantum information science.

### **Electron Quantum Optics**

We are developing a platform in which single electrons, rather than photons, serve as the flying quanta that mediate coherent interactions. Using on-demand electron sources, engineered one-dimensional waveguides, and quantum Hall edge channels, we aim to build the electronic analog of waveguide QED.

This platform enables:

- coherent electron–matter interactions with tunable coupling  
- single-electron interferometry and quantum-optical control  
- hybrid networks linking electrons, spins, and superconducting qubits  

Electron quantum optics opens a path toward quantum simulation and entanglement generation using mobile, strongly interacting electronic excitations.
