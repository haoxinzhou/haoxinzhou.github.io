Superconducting qubits and resonators provide quantum-limited sensitivity to charge, flux, and mechanical motion, making them powerful probes of macroscopic quantum behavior in correlated and topological materials. We use circuit QED (cQED) techniques to study:

- order-parameter fluctuations near quantum phase transitions  
- collective excitations such as plasmons, magnons, and amplitude modes  
- microscopic mechanisms behind unconventional superconductivity  

By coupling qubits to material excitations in the GHz regime, we reveal dynamical processes invisible to transport or optical probes, helping uncover how collective coherence emerges from interacting electrons.
